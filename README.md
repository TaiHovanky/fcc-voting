This is an app that allows users to create polls, vote on them, and view data visualizations (based on FreeCodeCamp's voting app). For this project, I decided to split the UI and the API for modularity. My learning goal with the overall voting app project is to learn more about MongoDB and Node on the backend and to practice with React and GraphQL on the frontend.

To run this project, run the "nodemon server.js" command in the project directory. To run the UI, download the voting app UI code and in a different terminal window, use the "npm run start" command.
